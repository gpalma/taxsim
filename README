This a source code release of TaxSim.
It has been tested on GNU/Linux.

TaxSim
===========
TaxSim is an engine with several taxonomic metrics
to pairs of terms in an ontology

1) LICENSE
===========
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2

2) VERSION
===========
1.1

3) CONTENT
==========
* src: source code
* test: set of test.
** test/ncit: NCIt graph and list of terms
** test/go: GO graph and list of terms
** test/snomed: SNOMED graph and list of terms
** test/ncitExamples: examples with NCIt Terms
** test/sr45: group 1 and 2 of the SR45 complex

4) REQUIREMENTS
===============
* GNU Colecction Compiler (gcc)
* GNU make (make).
* POSIX thread (pthread) libraries

5) INSTALLATION
===============
For GNU/Linux clean and generate necessary files

   $>make clean
   $>make

The executable file taxsim is generated in the taxsim directory

5) USAGE
========
The executable taxsim have 5 command line options. Three are mandatory
command line options. Here, mandatory means that without specifying this
option, the program won't work.

taxsim command synopsis:
	 taxsim [-m tax|str|ps] [-t <number of threads>] <graph> <terms> <annotations>

The options in brackets are not mandatory. The following are the command line options:

[-m tax|str|ps]   	# Taxonomic metric to use, where:
    			"tax" is (1-dtax) metric
			"str" is  (1 - d^{str}_{tax}) metric
			"ps" is (1- dps) metric by Viktor Pekar and Steffen Staab
[-t number of threads]	# Number of threads used to compute the metric between all pairs
[-d]			# Obtain the description of the annotations in the output.
[-l]			# Print the list of the Lower Common Ancestors between two terms.
<graph>			# Ontology graph file
<terms> 		# File with the terms of the ontology
<annotations> 		# File with the terms to compute the metric between them

The default values of the options are:

-m  	    : "tax"
-t	    : 1
-d	    : "No"
-l	    : "No"

6) RUNNING SOME SAMPLES
=======================
1) Compute the value of similarity between all pairs using the default values.

$>./taxsim  test/ncit/graphNCI.txt test/ncit/nci-term-desc.txt test/ncitExamples/nihEx.txt

2) Compute the value of similarity using the metric d^{str}_{tax}, and the 
Lower Commun Ancestors unsing one threads.

$>./taxsim -m str -l test/ncit/graphNCI.txt test/ncit/nci-term-desc.txt test/ncitExamples/drugs.txt

3) Compute the value of similarity using the metric d^{str}_{tax}, two threads, and 
get the description of the annotations.

$>./taxsim -m str -t 2 -d test/ncit/graphNCI.txt test/ncit/nci-term-desc.txt test/ncitExamples/drugs.txt

7) TaxSim File Formats
==========================
The following explains the formats of the files used in the computation of the metric.

7.1) Graph File Format
======================
The graph of the ontology must be an Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG).
The vertices of the graph are the identifiers of the terms of the ontology.
The first line has the following format:

<<number of nodes>>[TAB]<<number of arcs>>

Where <<number of nodes>> is the number de vertices of the graph,
[TAB] is the tab space, and <<number of arcs>> is the number the arcs
of the graph. The following lines in the file specify
a source node, a  target node, and the cost of the arc:

<<source node1>>[TAB]<<target node1 >>[TAB]<<cost1>>
..
..
..
<<source nodeN>>[TAB]<<target nodeN>>[TAB]<<costN>>

7.2) File format of identifiers
===============================
We have a file with the IDs of the terms of the ontology and its description
The format is as follows:
<<Number of terms>>
<<Term1>>[TAB]<<Description of the term1>>
..
..
..
<<TermN>>[TAB]<<Description of the termN>>

Note that the number of terms must be equal to the number of nodes of the graph.

7.3) Annotation File Format
===========================
The format is as follows:

<<Number of annotations>>
<<annotation1>>
..
..
..
<<annotationN>>

Where <<annotationX>> is the identifier of the annotation in the ontology.

I hope you find TaxSim an useful tool. Please, let me know
any comment, problem or suggestion.
